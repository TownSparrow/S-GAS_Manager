# S-GAS_Manager
Enables small language models (SLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to control massive contexts by adaptive swapping chunks between GPU and CPU memory. Applies semantic-graph relevance assessment before each query to dynamically manage information, allowing to go beyond VRAM on consumer hardware.
